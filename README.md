  Future plans
</h3>
<h4>
  NOTE: These are future plans. Time permitting, I will do the things below. After the list below is done (well up to three items at least), if you would like to contribute feel free to make a pull request.
  <br>
  <ol>
  <li>
              Make the naming of elements, css classes, and js variables+functions more systematic. Currently they are too verbose and not very descriptive of what is going on.
  </li>
  <li>
              A few of the icons, when clicked rapidly, will break. They still functional, but classes get misapplied.
  </li>
  <li>
                  Comment the code.
  </li>
  <li>
                See if there is a good way to make these icons accessible to all users (screen readers etc).
  </li>
  <li>
  Add new icons as we do more design challenges.
  </li>
</ol>
